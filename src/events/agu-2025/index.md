Submit abstracts to Pangeo-related sessions at AGU 2025!<br />
The submission deadline is **Wednesday, 30 July 2025 at 23:59 EDT/03:59 UTC**

## [Cross-Disciplinary Approaches to Science Data Systems Designs and Implementations](https://agu.confex.com/agu/agu25/prelim.cgi/Session/250823)

[**Abstract submission link**](https://agu.confex.com/agu/agu25/in/papers/index.cgi?sessionid=250823)<br />
Session ID: 250823<br />
Section: Informatics<br />
Conveners: Matthew Bourque, Veronica Martinez, Kyle Westfall, Julius Busecke<br />

Science data systems are vital for scientific discovery across a range of disciplines, yet their development has often been isolated within individual mission teams and/or subdomains. While open-source software promotes collaboration and software tool reuse, communication between project teams, developers, and scientists is necessary to develop innovative and highly reusable science data systems. This session highlights software tools for science data processing, collaborative projects with opportunities for joint development, and lessons learned from designing, implementing, testing, operating, and maintaining science data systems. We welcome submissions from software developers, mission teams, research scientists, and all who are passionate about enhancing science data systems through collaboration and innovation. Whether you’ve developed an open-source tool, faced challenges in its adoption, designed a science data system under mission constraints, or have lessons to share from operational experiences, we want to hear from you!

## [Open Source Geospatial Workflows in the Cloud: Tools and Techniques for Data Access, Analysis, Visualization, Storytelling, and Sharing in the Python and Jupyter ecosystem](https://agu.confex.com/agu/agu25/prelim.cgi/Session/252486)

[**Abstract submission link**](https://agu.confex.com/agu/agu25/in/papers/index.cgi?sessionid=252486)<br />
Session ID: 252486<br />
Section: Informatics<br />
Conveners: Quisheng Wu, Chelle Gentemann, Max Jones, Tyler Erickson, Wilson Sauthoff<br />

Open and fluid interoperability is increasingly crucial as geospatial data, from Earth system models to in-situ and remote observations, grow in size and complexity. This interoperability is both more challenging and impactful when workflows combine local and cloud platform resources. A growing ecosystem of science, education, and industry is emerging that shares open source tools and standards to democratize and facilitate access to data and compute. This session invites practitioners and developers exploring approaches to improve accessibility, usability, and capabilities of open source geospatial software, focusing on lowering technical barriers. By acknowledging both strengths and limitations of available tools, we aim to facilitate open conversations about what's working, what's missing, and what's next. We seek to convene tool builders and users to chart a more inclusive, community-driven path forward for open geospatial science, fostering better understanding of our world through enhanced access to data and computational resources.

## [Advancing Reproducible and FAIR Science: Tools, Practices, and Incentives](https://agu.confex.com/agu/agu25/prelim.cgi/Session/250586)

[**Abstract submission link**](https://agu.confex.com/agu/agu25/in/papers/index.cgi?sessionid=250586)<br />
Session ID: 250586<br />
Section: Informatics<br />
Conveners: Deborah Khider, Julien Emile-Geay, Nick McKay, David Edge<br />

Reproducibility and openness are not just ideals—they are necessities in today’s data-rich, software-driven scientific landscape. As geoscientists grapple with increasingly complex workflows and datasets, aligning with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles is critical for building trustworthy, reusable, and collaborative science.

This session invites researchers, developers, and community leaders to share:

- Reproducibility studies in the geosciences
- Tools, platforms, and workflows that support FAIR principles
- Incentives and recognition for open science practices
- Cultural or technical challenges—and innovative solutions

Whether you’re addressing technical infrastructure or driving cultural change, we want to hear how you’re helping move the geosciences toward a more transparent and FAIR future.
