## Overview

- **Pangeo Session - ESSI2.15** [https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU25/session/52079](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU25/session/52079)
- **Convener**:  [Tina Odaka](https://discourse.pangeo.io/u/tinaok)
- **Co-conveners**: [Anne Fouilloux](https://discourse.pangeo.io/u/annefou), [Alejandro Coca-Castro](https://discourse.pangeo.io/u/acocac), [Dean Summers](https://www.lampata.eu/), [Ross A. W. Slater](https://discourse.pangeo.io/u/raws)
- **When**: April 27 - May 2, 2025 (Specific date TBA)
- **Time**: TBA

**Goals**:
- to motivate researchers who are using or developing in the Pangeo ecosystem to share their endeavours with a broader community that can benefit from these new tools.
- to contribute to the Pangeo community in terms of potential new applications for the Pangeo ecosystem, containing the following core packages: Xarray, Iris, Dask, Jupyter, Zarr, Kerchunk and Intake.

## About
We warmly welcome contributions that detail various Cloud computing initiatives within the domains of Earth Observation and Earth System Modelling, including but not limited to:
- Cloud federations, scalability and interoperability initiatives across different domains, multi-provenance data, security, privacy and green and sustainable computing.
- Cloud applications, infrastructure and platforms (IaaS, PaaS SaaS and XaaS).
- Cloud-native AI/ML frameworks and tools for processing data.
- Operational systems on the cloud.
- Cloud computing and HPC convergence and workload unification for EO data processing.

Also, presentations using at least one of Pangeoâ€™s core packages in any of the following domains:
- Atmosphere, Ocean and Land Models
- Satellite Observations
- Machine Learning
- And other related applications

We welcome any contributions in the above themes presented as science-based in other EGU sessions, but more focused on research, data management, software and/or infrastructure aspects. For instance, you can showcase your implementation through live executable notebooks.
