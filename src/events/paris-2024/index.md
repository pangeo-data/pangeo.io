## Overview

Iâ€™m pleased to invite those who are interested to join a meeting in Paris (or virtual) that will take place on the 12th of November. The idea is to be able to meet European resident involved in this community, but also to confront Pangeo ecosystem to CNES (French space agency) needs. It will this be splitted in at least two sessions, one general session about Pangeo, and one more focused on CNES work and potential collaboration with the community.

This meeting will be limited to about 30 people in place, so please fill [this Google document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1goKPEfsv784jnfEz-5zup9i_ociPz7Ck4fUrdfeIw3s)!
